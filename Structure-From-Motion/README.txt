Objective:   
Step 1.) Build a mean-centered matrix called W which will house the centered image points. From W, use singular value decomposition to decompose W into U, D, and V matrices, and manipulate them to create R and S    
Step 2.) Solve for matrix Q that will satisfy the unit-vector and orthogonality constraints that must be assumed for image points 𝑖ℎ and 𝑗ℎ.   
Step 3.) Perform SfM factorization on a given set of corresponding image points.     
Step 4.) Given a set number of frames and region points that correspond to 4 points of a quadrilateral planar region, extract the texture from the region averaged over all images.
